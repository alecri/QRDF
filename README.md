# QRDF
A shiny app for QRDF


The folder is structured as in the typical folder for a shiny app.
It contains:

- ui.R for designing the user interface of the application;
- server.R for the actual computations and output;
- global.R for useful functions and default settings;
- www/ folder where to host data. **The data are empty** because they cannot be share for *ethical reasons* and *privacy*.

Additional R script may be temporary and help out throughout the project.
